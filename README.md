Beaglebone black PWM
========================================

Introduction
----------------------------------------

This repository is to share files I gathered on the web to enable pulse-witdh modulation (pwm)
for the Beaglebone black (works with other beaglebone versions, but not sure which). All the examples
are for Archlinuxarm, but it should be the same for all the distros.

pwm_test
----------------------------------------
Contains the files for the userspace driver interface (sysfs) *mandatory*

dts
----------------------------------------
Contains the file for the device-tree overlays.
